# The Prawn Projects - Automated Neobrutalist Portfolio

A high-contrast, self-updating portfolio styled in a raw Neobrutalist aesthetic. This application automatically connects to the Vercel API to fetch and display your latest deployed projects, ensuring your portfolio is always in sync with your work.

## Features

- **Automated Project Fetching**: Pulls live deployment data directly from Vercel using the REST API.
- **Neobrutalist Design**: Bold typography (Space Grotesk), high-contrast borders, hard shadows, and a stark black/white/yellow color palette.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fluid grid system that adapts from mobile to desktop.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Displays project names, frameworks, and direct links to live deployments.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Component-based UI architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom configuration for the Neobrutalist theme.
- **Vercel API**: Data source for project metadata and deployment status.
- **Space Grotesk**: Primary typeface.

## Configuration

To connect the application to your Vercel account, you must configure the following environment variables in your deployment settings or local environment file (`.env` or similar).
